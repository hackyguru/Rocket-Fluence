# Rocket - Fluence Integration

Rocket is a browser extension that can do alot of functionalities using IPFS, NFT.storage and Fluence. You can easily setup a local node with a click of a button.

## Work done during GR11 Hackathon

During GR11 hackathon, I have integrated Fluence for a feature which gives the trust score of a website based on the votings from previous visitors. Fir an example, when you visit a scam site scammer123.com, you will see a very low trust score (based on the inputs from the previous users who visited the same website). This functionality can help users know if a website is legit and can help them stay safe from traps.
